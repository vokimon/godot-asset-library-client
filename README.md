Interact with the Godot Asset Library

This script retrieves all the information already available
in the project to upload a Godot asset into the Godot asset library.

## Features

- Smart metadata gathering: do not duplicate metadata again
- Reuses existing pending edits of the same release in the library to enable corrections.
- Smart behaviour with existing previews
- Shortcuts for previews hosted youtube or the repository
- Easy integration in Github actions or any other CI/CD platform.

## Install

```bash
pip install godot-asset-library-client
```

## Usage

- Define `GODOT_ASSET_LIB_USER` and `GODOT_ASSET_LIB_PASSWORD` environment variables.
  You may use a .env file with them but consider security concerns.

- Write a yaml metadata file with content similar to this:

```yaml
# asset-metadata.yaml

asset_id: '6666666' # You will obtain this id after the first publication by hand
category: "1" # 2D Tools. See available values in https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api/configure
project_license: AGPLv3
previews:

# Shortcut for youtube previews
- youtube: AD8awHLpFxs

# Shortcut for media commited in the repository
- repoimage: /screenshots/screenshot1.png
  repothumb: /screenshots/screenshot1-thumb.jpg

# If not shortcutted the preview entry should look like this
- type: image
  link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vokimon/godot-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/screenshots/screenshot2.png
  thumbnail: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vokimon/godot-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/screenshots/screenshot2-thumb.jpg

# These will be concatenated and processed as description
description_files:
- README.md
- CHANGES.md
```

Then, from the root of your project (where `project.godot` resides):

```bash
godot-asset-library-client upload asset-metadata.yaml
```

Check that the metadata is correct, and then add the option `--do`:

```bash
godot-asset-library-client upload asset-metadata.yaml --do
```

### Smart metadata guessing

If not explicitly provided,
it takes most metadata from existing files in your repository
so you don't have to duplicate that.

From `project.godot`:

- Project name
- Project version
- Project description
- Project icon
- Godot version

From local git:

- Commit hash
- Current branch
- Repository hosting (only for supported hostings)
- Repository name (only for supported hostings)

Supported git hostings are:

- Github
- Bitbucket
- Gitea

If your hosting is not listed, you always can explicit the inferred parameters.
Or, better, send a PR to add your hosting.
Hostings are defined in `git.py` and tested in `git_test.py`.
They are quite easy to add but I do not have repositories in all of them to test,
so pull requests are very welcome.


## Integration with Github Actions

Provided that you already have a working `asset-metadata.yaml` in your repository
you can add a github action to have the extension updated on each release.

Go to Github `Your Project / Settings / Secrets and Variables / Actions / Repository secrets`.
Once there, add your secrets `GODOT_ASSET_LIB_USER` and `GODOT_ASSET_LIB_PASSWORD`.

Add this file to your repo:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Upload Plugin to Godot Asset Library

on:
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch: # this enables on demand execution, useful when the release fails

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Publish new version to asset lib
    steps:

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Godot Asset Lib
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "GODOT_ASSET_LIB_USER=${{ secrets.GODOT_ASSET_LIB_USER }}" >> .env
        echo "GODOT_ASSET_LIB_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.GODOT_ASSET_LIB_PASSWORD }}" >> .env
        pip install --user godot-asset-library-client
        godot-asset-library-client upload asset-metadata.yaml --do
```

You may want to remove the `--do` option until you are sure
you are not uploading garbage to the asset library.


## TODO

Sure you can help with those:

- Solve the emoji problem by not removing them. The blacklist is quite limited and fragile.
- Support first upload of a project
- Auto-identify license available in repository
- Auto-identify repo name from git remote for non github hostings
- Auto-identify repo hosting for non github hostings
