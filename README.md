Interact with the Godot Asset Library

This script retrieves all the information already available
in the project to upload an Godot asset into the Godot asset library.

## Features

- Smart metadata gathering: avoid duplicating information already there
- Smart behaviour with existing pending edits
- Smart behaviour with existing previews (still not working)
- Shortcuts for previews hosted youtube or the repository (still not working)

## Install

```bash
pip install godot-asset-library-client
```

## Usage

- Define `ASSET_STORE_USER` and `ASSET_STORE_PASSWORD` environment variables.
  You may use a .env file with them but consider security concerns.

- Write a yaml metadata file with content like this

```yaml
asset_id: '6666666' # You will obtain this id after the first publish by hand
repo_hosting: GitHub
repo: vokimon/godot-dice-roller
branch: main
category: "1" # 2D Tools
project_license: AGPLv3
previews:

# Shortcut for youtube previews
- youtube: AD8awHLpFxs

# Shortcut for media commited in the repository
- repoimage: /screenshots/example-landscape.png
  repothumb: /screenshots/example-landscape-thumb.jpg

# If not shortcutted the preview entry should look like this
- type: image
  link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vokimon/godot-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/screenshots/example-portrait.png
  thumbnail: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vokimon/godot-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/screenshots/example-portrait-thumb.jpg

# These will be concatenated and processed as description
description_files:
- README.md
- CHANGES.md
```

### Smart metadata guessing

If not explicitly provided,
it takes most metadata from existing files in your repository
so you don't have to duplicate that.

From `project.godot`:

- Project name
- Project version
- Project description
- Project icon
- Godot version

From local git:

- Commit hash

## TODO

- BUG: Previews are generated as json but the api returns a warning and ignores them
- Expressive CLI interface with subcommands and options
- Solve the emoji problem by not removing them
- Solution to the first upload
- Identify license available in repository
- Identify branch from current branch
- Identify repo name from git remote
